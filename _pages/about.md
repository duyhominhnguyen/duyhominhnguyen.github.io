I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate under the supervision of [Prof. Mathias Niepert](https://www.matlog.net/) at Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems ([IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)) and [University of Stuttgart](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/). I have also been a researcher at German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence ([DFKI](https://www.dfki.de/en/web)) since 2021.

My topics of interest are Hybrid Discrete-Continuous Learning (differentiable relaxations for discrete intermediate representations), Scalable Algorithms for Multi-modal Learning with applications for Healthcare, Simulation Science, and Efficient Deep Learning (model compression, accelerated training/inference, etc.) 

Please visit my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_NIyeykAAAAJ) for a full list of publications and [GitHub](https://github.com/duyhominhnguyen) for source codes.
