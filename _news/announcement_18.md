🔔 Happy to share our latest work [Slot-VLA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06754), accepted at [ICRA 2026](https://2026.ieee-icra.org/) in Vienna, Austria 🇦🇹 🎉. We show that **object–relation–centric slot representations** enable _compact, interpretable, and efficient multi-task robotic manipulation_, drastically reducing token complexity while maintaining strong performance and generalization.
